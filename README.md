# NFLRouteAnalytics
This repository tracks my progress for a semester-long data science project for SML312: Research Projects in Data Science. This project aims to answer the guiding question: How can we leverage ML techniques to understand offensive effectiveness and predictability in the NFL?

# Datasets
Large datasets were unable to be added to this repository for free. I have created a Google Drive link to the compressed directories to be added locally to run the various notebooks in this repository. Just unzip the directories from Drive and store them in the same local directory as the notebooks. The large CSV file for this project is stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mY1Z-M1OKmR69SILIt2_XveR6baug5Iw?usp=sharing). You can download the file by following the link.
